## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Make dataframe
First, make a data frame using **airquality** data. And then, we can see that there are NA values. Or you can briefly check data frame using *head* function. 

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
mydata <- data.frame(airquality)
mydata

head(mydata)
```

## Remove NA
Next, to remove NA values, use *complete.cases* function. After removing NA values, save new data frame into new name. And after that, by using *is.na* function, we can find out that all NA values are removed.

```{r}
good <- complete.cases(mydata)

mydata2 <- mydata[good,]
is.na(mydata2)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
